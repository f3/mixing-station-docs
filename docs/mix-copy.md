# Mix copy

The mix copy feature lets you copy a mix to another mix.
This is useful when you want to use the LR mix as a starting point for an in-ear mix
or if you simply want to copy a monitor mix to another monitor mix.

## Usage

```menu
Select channel -> SENDS -> Menu -> Mix Copy
```

To use the mix copy feature open any channel and select "SENDS".
Then press the gear icon in the top menu bar and select "Mix Copy".

On the `Source` side select the mix that you want to copy.
On the `Destination` side select the mix where the data should be pasted.
Press the `Copy` button to start the copy process.

**The target mix will be muted.**
This is a safety feature to avoid feedback or a sudden increase in volume.
Don't forget to unmute the target mix!
