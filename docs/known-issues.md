# Known bugs and limitations

This page lists all known bugs and limitation of the app.

## Android

### Samsung keyboard issues

After the latest Samsung OS update it's not possible to enter an IP address into the text field.
This is caused by a validation bug of the keyboard. As a workaround you have two options:

- Copy/paste the IP into the textfield
- Use the `search` button

## iOS

### Turn screen off

When turning the screen off iOS will terminate any network connections. Therefore the app will lose any connections and you must reconnect.
It's recommended to keep the screen on. By default, Mixing Station keeps the screen on so it will not turn off automatically.
